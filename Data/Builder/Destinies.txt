The cold damage and knockdown are negated on a successful Fortitude save vs. 10 + Wisdom modifier + Character level. Some monsters can resist Tsunami completely, such as Water Elementals and Oozes.}Bug:  When Tsunami is cast with the Quicken Spell Metamagic[1], the knockdown cannot be negated, regardless of DC or Fortitude save, as long as the monster does not resist Tsunami completely (is not an Ooze, Plant, etc) and can be knocked down (is not a wraith, ghost, turret, etc). This makes it an effective form of no-save crowd control against a huge portion of enemies in DDO. (If you do not use Quicken, the knockdown portion can fail.)}Bug: The damage does not scale with character level, for many classes. It seems to scale properly with Druid level. It definitely does not scale with character level for Sorcerer, Bard, Favored Soul, and Cleric. For these classes, the damage is as if the spell were cast at character level 1 (base total 30 + 1d10 cold + 30 + 1d10 bludgeoning damage, which is then modified by spellpower and critical chance).
