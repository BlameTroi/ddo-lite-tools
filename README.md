# DDO Lite Tools
A public github repository for EllisDee37's original DDO Lite Tools

## How To Get The Tools
You can either clone the repository using Git, or click the green download button towards the top right of this page.  There will be an option to download as a zip there.  Once you download that file and unzip it, you will then also need to unzip the `executables.zip` file into the same directory, so that the `Utils` folder and executables are all in the same directory as the other directories.

## Contributing
I hope to allow collaborating in the project in a number of ways.

1. Using Github
   1. Fork the project to your account
   1. Make any changes that are necessary
   1. Verify the changes locally
   1. <sup>(1)</sup> Create a merge/pull request back to this repository
   1. <sup>(2)</sup>I will attempt to verify the changes do not corrupt the program, and if they appear not to, I will merge the changes into master

1. Using the DDO Forums
   1. You can note needed changes on the DDO Forums under the [Guides & Strategies](https://www.ddo.com/forums/forumdisplay.php/104-Guides-amp-Strategies) section, in the "CHARACTER BUILDER LITE - GITHUB" thread.
   1. <sup>(2)</sup>I will try to periodically check this thread for any posts and apply the changes when I can.

<sup>(1)</sup>Merge and pull requests with github will be new to me, so there may be a learning period for a bit on how to make this work smoothly.

<sup>(2)</sup>If you are familiar with Github and would like to take part in the handling of merge/pull requests, you can private message me (Amundir) on the forums with your github account name and we can see about adding more people to the process.
