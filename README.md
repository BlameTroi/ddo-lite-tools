## Background
These tools were created by EllisDee37, but stopped being updated in 2018-05-25.  
I've taken the original VB6 code and added the Alchemist class and will be making minor updates 
as SSG releases them.

## GitHub Repo
The code and releases are available at https://github.com/ChristopherGLewis/ddo-lite-tools
Any issues and input should be filed there.
