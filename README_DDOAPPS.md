# DDO Character Builder Lite
DDO Character Builder Lite is a very simple to use Character Builder, Adventure Compendium, and Cannith Crafting Planner. The interface and output are kept intentionally simple for ease of readability and posting. 

The builder is lovingly maintained by a dedicated group who prefer the look and feel of it versus the more graphically intense DDO Character Planner that @Maetrims maintains.

## How To Get The Tools
The simplest way to use the tools is to download the current release located here:[ddo-lite-tools/releases](https://github.com/ChristopherGLewis/ddo-lite-tools/releases)
and selecting the latest release.

Once you download that file, unblock it (right click, properties and uncheck the "unblock" checkbox) and unzip it to any directory.  If you save it to a protected directory such as `C:\Windows` or `C:\Program Files`, you will need to run it as Administrator.  I suggest using `C:\DDOCharLite`.

## Compatibility (from @Yhelm)

Written in pure VB6 native code, all programs should run on any version of Windows, no installation required.

Mac and Linux can run it using <r>Wine</r> or <r>CrossOver</r>. For CrossOver, install with the following:
* Microsoft Visual Basic 6 Runtime Service Pack 6
Next, use "Run Command" and browse for the .exe file to run (CannithCrafting, CharacterBuilderLite, or Compendium), and press "Save Command as a Launcher". Do this for all three .exe files.

You can also clone the repository using Git:
   * git clone https://github.com/ChristopherGLewis/ddo-lite-tools.git

You can compile the VB6 code or just use the current data files in the data folder with your current executable.
